      <h4>What is Bi-cinditional/Ternary?</h4>
      <p>
        The ternary operator evaluates the condition. If the condition is
        truthy, the expressionIfTrue is executed, and its result becomes the
        value of the entire ternary operation. If the condition is falsy, the
        expressionIfFalse is executed, and its result becomes the value of the
        entire operation.
      </p>
      <pre><code language="javascript">let variable = condition ? expression : expression</code></pre>
      <h4>What is Nullish operator (??)</h4>
      <p>
        The ?? operator returns its right-hand side operand only when its
        left-hand side operand is either null or undefined. In all other cases,
        it returns the left-hand side operand.
      </p>
      <h5>Key difference between the Nullish (??) Logical OR operator (||)</h5>
      <p>
        Unlike the || operator, which returns the right-hand side operand for
        any "falsy" value (including 0, false, NaN, and empty strings ""), the
        ?? operator specifically targets null and undefined. This means that
        values like 0 or empty strings are considered valid and will be returned
        by the ?? operator, whereas the || operator would treat them as falsy
        and return the default value.
      </p>
      <pre><code language="javascript">let firstName = null;
let username = firstName ?? "Guest"; // username will be "Guest"

let age = 0;
let userAge = age ?? 18; // userAge will be 0 (because 0 is not null or undefined)

let city = undefined;
let userCity = city ?? "Unknown"; // userCity will be "Unknown"</code></pre>
      <h5>Wht Nullish operator is valuable?</h5>
      <p>
        The Nullish Coalescing Operator is a useful tool for setting default
        values when you specifically want to differentiate between truly missing
        values (null or undefined) and other potentially "falsy" but still
        meaningful values.
